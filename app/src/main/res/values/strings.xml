        to see if you can guess the random code set at hte beginning of the game.
        \n\n
        1. When you begin a new game, a 4 letter code is \n\t set by the system.\n\n
        2. You have to guess the code using the 6 letters \n\t A,B,C,D,E,F which are seen on the play screen as buttons.\n\n

        </string>
        \n
        7. Using these hints, you will be trying to decode the code.\n
